# A case study of data wrangling using the City of London Open Street Map data

## Abstract

The project explores the City of London in the United Kingdom using the information available in the Open Street Map. The purpose of the project is to use Data Wrangling techniques in Python to load, audit, clean and export an Open Street Map file, for further analysis using SQLite and Python data analysis libraries. The City of London geographical area is used as a case study.

* <b>final report.pdf:</b> <i>Final report containing the results of the case study.</i>
* <b>audit_city_of_london.ipynb:</b> Jupyter notebook containing the results and the code used to audit the Open Street Map file.
* <b>write_csv.ipynb:</b> Jupyter notebook containing the code used to write the CSV file that was later imported to SQLite.
* <b>Map link.txt:</b> Contains the link to the Open Street Map dataset used in the project.
* <b>sample_city_of_london.osm:</b> A 10 MB sample Open Street Map (OSM) file of the 295 mb OSM used in the project.
